If you were to open a Shopify store, what would you sell and why (or tell us about your store if you have one!) (200 word limit)

If I were to open a Shopify store, I would sell customised athletic apparel with a focus towards jerseys for sports teams. This is because of my passion and involvement in team sports. One of my favourite pastimes is playing some sort of sport and engaging in physical activity. Throughout my life, I have always been a part of a hockey, basketball, or soccer team. To be on a team with individuals of all different kinds of backgrounds, putting aside differences, and working together on a common goal is something I genuinely love being a part of. In addition, team sports have allowed me to create meaningful friendships and lifelong bonds with people I would have never met if it were not for team sports. Working with other individuals in team sports has also prepared me for team-like environments outside of sports and has also given me the opportunity to learn the qualities of what makes a good leader.
